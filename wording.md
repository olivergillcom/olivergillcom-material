# Gaming
Flicking between PC and Consoles, I have always enjoyed digital escapism. It's easy to spot patterns of activity retrospectively, and my gaming habits can loosely be split into A-Games and B-Games. A-Games are more active, pressured and a great source of adrenaline e.g. First Person Shooters and Sim Racing. B-Games are more laid back and serve as a relaxant, adventure crafters and more casual titles.

30 minutes and a bit of Google-fu can get any rough concept to a good starting position. An ugly recent shift in society is the aggrandising of everything for the sole purpose of gate-keeping. The idea that you need to be fully invested in something to make use of it puts many people off and is ultimately false. Luckily I have been prototyping since kindergarten and still love to hack things together to prove a concept, suss out it's potential value, or just to see what happens. My greatest passion is helping others with their first step and holding the torch (or soldiering iron) through the murky beginnings.


# Work
## Intro

### consultant on paper
If I describe myself as a consultant, nobody knows what that means, and for good reason. The issue with naming "consulting" as a career is how much of a catch-all umbrella term it has come to mean, and therefore by extension has become meaningless. If I were to write out all the roles I have performed, contractually and otherwise, there would be few areas I haven't touched. The bulk of the work I have been down to do on paper has been under the guise of either technical or business analysis, product development or digital strategy. Rather than roll off my CV, I feel it's best to explain what I actually end up doing which also turns out to be what I find most enjoyable.

### what I actually do and enjoy
